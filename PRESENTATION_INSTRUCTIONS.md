Mindtrace Enhancement Assignment Presentation Guidelines
===========================================================

Presentation Overview
---------------------
Duration:
  - 30-minute presentation
  - 30-minute Q&A session

Objectives:
  - Summarize the enhancements you implemented on the Mindtrace library.
  - Explain the architecture and key design decisions made during the assignment.
  - Highlight your integration of a testing framework, development of FastAPI endpoints, and enhancements to the model 
  registry.
  - Discuss future improvement ideas for scaling and production-readiness.
  - Reflect on your approach to mentoring team members and facilitating effective code reviews.

Content to Cover
----------------
1. Overview
   - Introduce your approach to extending the library.
   - Summarize the key enhancements you implemented.

2. Architecture & Design
   - Present an architectural overview showing how the new components (tests, API endpoints, registry enhancements) 
   interact with the existing system.
   - Explain your design decisions and trade-offs to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
   - **On-Prem Deployment Considerations:**  
       * Discuss how you would adapt the architecture for an on-prem deployment.
       * What additional components (e.g., on-prem load balancers, internal registries, secure network configurations) 
       would be needed?
       * How would you handle data security, compliance, and network isolation in an on-prem environment?
       * Address any challenges you foresee and possible strategies to mitigate them.
   - Include diagrams or visuals if helpful.

3. Implementation Details
   - Testing Framework:
       * Describe the tests you set up (unit tests for helper functions and integration tests for the MNIST dataset).
       * Explain how the tests ensure code reliability.
   - FastAPI Endpoints:
       * Walk through the implementation of the /inference and /retrain endpoints.
       * Highlight error handling and API documentation features.
   - Enhanced Model Registry:
       * Discuss improvements to the MLflow callback (additional metadata, versioning, query interface).
       * Explain how users can interact with the registry.
   - (Optional) Demo:
       * Provide a brief live or recorded demonstration of the working endpoints or testing process.

4. Future Considerations
   - Outline further improvements or features you would add with additional time.
   - Discuss strategies for scaling the registry, improving reliability, and automating workflows in production.
   - Specifically, detail how you would adjust the architecture for an on-prem deployment:
       * What infrastructure modifications would be required?
       * How would you integrate monitoring, logging, and failover mechanisms in an on-prem setting?
       * What security considerations would come into play?

5. Leadership Reflection
   - Share how you would mentor junior team members and lead technical discussions.
   - Describe your strategies for effective code reviews and collaborative problem-solving.

Presentation Tips
-----------------
  - Be clear, concise, and focus on key points.
  - Use visuals (diagrams, slides, or code snippets) to support your explanations.
  - Practice explaining technical details for both technical and non-technical audiences.
  - Prepare for follow-up questions during the Q&A session.

Good luck with your presentation â€“ we look forward to your insights and discussion!
